# Welcome to My Dashboard

This is the first post on my new personal dashboard. I built this using:

- **Next.js 14** (App Router)
- **TypeScript**
- **Tailwind CSS**
- **Shadcn UI**

## Features

1. **GitHub Stats**: Track my repositories and commit activity
2. **Todo List**: Manage daily tasks
3. **Blog**: Share thoughts and updates (like this one!)

Stay tuned for more updates!
